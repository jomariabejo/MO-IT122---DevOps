# BrainBytes Solutions

BrainBytes Solutions is a Manila-based educational technology startup founded in 2023 by a group of former educators and technology enthusiasts. The company's mission is to make quality educational support accessible to Filipino students across the country, especially those in areas with limited access to tutoring resources.

With a small team of 6 developers and educators, BrainBytes aims to leverage artificial intelligence to provide affordable, 24/7 tutoring assistance that can help students understand difficult concepts, practice problem-solving, and prepare for exams.

## Business Challenge
The Philippines faces significant educational challenges, with many students unable to access quality tutoring due to geographical or economic constraints. During the pandemic, this digital divide became even more apparent as education moved online.

BrainBytes identified an opportunity to create an AI-powered chat platform that could provide immediate academic assistance at a fraction of the cost of traditional tutoring. However, as a small startup with limited funding, they face several challenges:

- Developing a reliable platform with minimal resources
- Ensuring consistent uptime with a small technical team
- Deploying and updating the platform efficiently
- Monitoring performance to maintain quality service
- Scaling gradually while minimizing operational overhead

### Why Devops Matters?
- Maximize efficiency through automation and streamlined workflows
- Ensure reliability without requiring 24/7 human monitoring
- Deploy updates quickly to respond to user feedback and fix issues
- Scale gradually without rebuilding their infrastructure
- Maintain quality while moving quickly

# Our DevOps Journey: Building BrainBytes AI Tutoring Platform

## The Challenge
- They need to build a reliable application with only a small team
- They must operate within the constraints of free-tier cloud resources
- They need to automate as much as possible to minimize manual work
- They must ensure the platform remains reliable and responsive
